# Product Context: CHORUS-TRE

## 1. The Problem: The Challenges of Distributed Infrastructure Management

Before the CHORUS-TRE repository was established, managing the infrastructure for the CHORUS project faced several significant challenges:

*   **Environment Inconsistency**: Development, testing, and production environments would inevitably drift from one another. Different versions of services or configurations would lead to bugs that were difficult to reproduce and fix, creating a classic "it works on my machine" scenario.
*   **Manual, Error-Prone Deployments**: Deploying and updating services was a manual process. This was not only time-consuming but also highly susceptible to human error. A small mistake in a configuration value could lead to service downtime or incorrect behavior.
*   **Lack of Versioning and Traceability**: There was no single source of truth for the state of the infrastructure. It was difficult to track what changes were made, when they were made, and by whom. Rolling back to a previous stable state was a complex and unreliable procedure.
*   **Siloed Knowledge**: The expertise required to deploy and manage the infrastructure was concentrated among a few key individuals. This created bottlenecks and made it difficult for new team members to contribute effectively.

## 2. The Solution: A Centralized, Automated, and Version-Controlled Approach

CHORUS-TRE was created to solve these problems by providing a unified and automated system for managing the project's infrastructure. It acts as the backbone for all deployments, ensuring they are consistent, repeatable, and transparent.

### User-Centric Goals:

From the perspective of a developer or operator working on the CHORUS project, the goals are:

*   **Confidence in Deployments**: "I want to be able to deploy my application to any environment with a single, reliable process, knowing that it will behave consistently everywhere."
*   **A Single Source of Truth**: "I want one place to look to understand the exact configuration and version of every service running in our clusters."
*   **Safe and Easy Contributions**: "I want a straightforward and safe way to update a service or add a new one, with automated checks to prevent common errors."
*   **Simplified Operations**: "I want to spend less time on manual deployment tasks and more time building and improving our applications."
