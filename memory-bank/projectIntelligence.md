# Project Intelligence

This document captures key insights, patterns, and decisions made throughout the lifecycle of the CHORUS-TRE project.

## 1. The Memory Bank Pattern

*   **Date**: 2024-07-24
*   **Insight**: The project's complexity, particularly with its distributed GitOps architecture, necessitates a robust and centralized knowledge base. To address this, we have established a "Memory Bank"â€”a collection of structured markdown documents located in the `/memory-bank` directory.
*   **Rationale**: As an AI assistant with a session-based memory, I rely entirely on this written documentation to maintain context and work effectively. This system ensures that all project knowledge is explicit, version-controlled, and accessible, reducing reliance on individual team members' memory and preventing knowledge silos.
*   **Pattern**: At the start of any work session, a full review of the Memory Bank is the first and most critical step. Any significant changes, discoveries, or decisions made during the session **must** be documented in the relevant file before the session concludes. This ensures that the knowledge base remains perpetually up-to-date.
