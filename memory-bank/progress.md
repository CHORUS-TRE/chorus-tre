# Project Progress

**Date**: 2024-07-24

## What Works

*   **Initial Memory Bank Structure**: The foundational structure for the project's knowledge base has been successfully created. This includes the `memory-bank` directory and all core documentation files.
*   **Core Documentation Population**: The following key documents have been populated with their initial content, providing a comprehensive overview of the project:
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `activeContext.md`

## What's Left to Build

*   The immediate next step is to add the first entry to the `projectIntelligence.md` file.
*   Beyond this initial setup, the project is ready for its next operational or development task. The backlog of tasks has not yet been defined in this context.

## Known Issues

*   There are currently **no known issues**. The project's documentation and structure are considered to be in a clean, initial state.
