## Current Focus: Establishing the Project's Knowledge Base

The primary focus of the current work session is to establish a comprehensive and maintainable knowledge base for the CHORUS-TRE project. This process, which we are calling "updating the memory bank," involves creating and populating a series of core documents that will serve as the foundation for all future development and operational work.

## Next Steps

1.  **Complete Initial Documentation**: Finalize the initial population of all core memory bank documents (`progress.md`, `projectIntelligence.md`).
2.  **Review and Refine**: Review the newly created documentation with the project team to ensure accuracy and completeness.
3.  **Begin Next Task**: Once the memory bank is established and verified, we can move on to the next development or operational task, using this knowledge base as our guide.
